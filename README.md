Sales Analytics Dashboard (Power BI)

Project Overview  
This project explores sales performance using Power BI, providing an interactive view of revenue, profit, and sales distribution across products, customers, and regions.  
The goal was to transform raw data into meaningful insights and show how visualization can drive better business understanding.  
The layout was first wireframed in PowerPoint before building the final Power BI dashboard.



Objectives  
- Monitor key metrics such as revenue, quantity sold, and average profit.  
- Identify top-performing regions, customers, and product categories.  
- Compare year-on-year performance and uncover profitability gaps.  
- Showcase storytelling through clean, insight-driven dashboard design.



Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
The process included:  
- Cleaning and transforming raw data in Power Query.  
- Creating calculated measures for Revenue, Profit Margin, and Average Profit.  
- Establishing model relationships between datasets.  
- Designing dynamic visuals using slicers and filters for interactivity.
